# glusterfs-java-filesystem

This project aims to be a complete implementation of a Java7/NIO.2 File System Provider backed by
[GlusterFS](http://www.gluster.org/) via [libgfapi-jni](https://github.com/semiosis/libgfapi-jni)

Please let me know if you use this project, even if you're just checking it out, I'd like to hear from you.

I prefer to be contacted on IRC, Twitter, or a Github issue.  You can find me, semiosis, in #gluster on Freenode IRC.  My twitter handle is @pragmaticism.

Thanks!

# Use

## Adding to your maven project

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.peircean.glusterfs</groupId>
            <artifactId>glusterfs-java-filesystem</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.2</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

## Adding to your non-maven project

The maven shade plugin can build a unified (shaded) JAR suitable for dropping in to the classpath of any JVM application.

You can build a "shaded" JAR by cloning the project and running the following command in the glusterfs-java-filesystem subdirectory:

    cd glusterfs-java-filesystem
    mvn package shade:shade

Maven will report the path of this shaded JAR.  You can run `export CLASSPATH=<path-to-shaded.jar>` in a terminal before running your other application.

Contact me (on IRC, Twitter, or in a Github issue) if you need help obtaining a JAR, if you can't, or don't want to, build it with maven yourself.

## Access GlusterFS volumes with the NIO.2 API

Once this library is in your classpath all you need to do in your code is access a GlusterFS URI, for example

    gluster://server:volume/path

## Example usage

A Vagrantfile in the root of this repository sets up a VM with a volume called *foo* at IP address *172.31.31.31* on a 
private network.

The [Example.java](glusterfs-java-filesystem-example/src/main/java/com/peircean/glusterfs/example/Example.java) file in 
the glusterfs-java-filesystem-example project provides a demonstration of the capabilities of this project from a high 
level consumer's point of view, it connects to the volume on the vagrant VM.

To run:

    cd glusterfs-java-filesystem-example
    vagrant up
    mvn exec:exec

# Roadmap

### TODO:

- Delete files
- Copy files
- Align project versions with glusterfs (this project & libgfapi-jni)
- Update watch service to use [libgfchangelog](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/master/xlators/features/changelog/lib/examples/c/get-changes.c) (instead of polling)
- Finish attribute support   
    Owner/group names & ability to change   
    More ways to set permissions
- Advanced synchronous file I/O   
    Seeking & reading/writing a portion of a file
- Asychronous file I/O
- Better error reporting & handling
- Publish test coverage report to Coveralls.io   
    [Blocked](https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/36) due to use of Atlassian Clover

### Completed:

- Connect to a GlusterFS volume using the NIO.2 API
- Basic synchronous file I/O   
    Read the contents of a file all at once   
    Write a chunk of bytes to a file all at once
- File attributes   
    See owner/group id, size, permissions, and last modified timestamp on files and directories   
    Set permissions
- Filesystem/volume stats   
    See the total, free, and usable bytes in a volume
- Directory listing (with filtering)
- Move/rename files
- Watch files for changes   
    Complete except for GlusterWatchKeyTest, in progress
- Publish test coverage & code quality reports to [SonarQube](http://sonar.peircean.com/dashboard/index/com.peircean.glusterfs:glusterfs-java-filesystem)
